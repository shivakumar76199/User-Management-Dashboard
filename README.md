## Project Overview

This is a simple **User Management Dashboard** built using **React** and the browser **Fetch API**.  
It demonstrates basic CRUD operations (View, Add, Edit, Delete) against a mock backend (JSONPlaceholder). The UI supports search, column sorting, pagination, and client-side validation for the user form.

**Important note:** JSONPlaceholder simulates POST/PUT/DELETE responses but does **not** persist changes. The app updates the UI optimistically (client-side) so the app behaves as if the backend accepted changes.

## Features Implemented

- Fetch and display users from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- View user list with columns: **ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Department**
- Add new user (POST request, optimistic UI update)
- Edit existing user (PUT request, optimistic UI update)
- Delete user (DELETE request, optimistic UI update)
- Client-side input validation (required fields and basic email validation)
- Search across name, email, and department
- Sort by first name, last name, email, department (click column header)
- Pagination with page-size options: 10, 25, 50, 100
- Responsive layout (simple, responsive container)
